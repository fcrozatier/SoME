Subject: SoMEÏ€ Community Edition

June is on its way! That means the Summer of Math Exposition Ï€ started! ðŸŽ‰

You have until the 18th of August to create a video, blog, interactive website, video game, etc. that explains something in or around mathematics. Learn more at https://some.3b1b.co

In this edition we have improved and simplified the peer-review: this time, you will only rate a single entry at a time on how good it is. The exact process and ranking algorithm will be explained on the SoME website at some point.

After the peer-review, we will publish a ranked list of the entries. Please don't work yourself up over the exact position your entry will end up at. The goal of the event is to have more maths explainers, as well as a boost in the YouTube algorithm. Everyone who submits something is already a winner, regardless of their placement.

Speaking of winners. Remember that this iteration is community-driven and therefore there is no prize money and no official winner video on the 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel. Please focus on creating something that brings you joy.

Lastly, feel free to join our Discord, where you can find collaborators and resources to get you started, share progress, and ask questions about the event.

Happy creating!

The SoME team

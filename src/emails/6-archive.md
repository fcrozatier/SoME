Hi,

We are excited to announce the launch of the Archive of Math Expositions! This provides a dedicated space where you can explore all past entries to the Summer of Math Exposition competitions.

You can explore entries by year and category, making it a valuable resource for learning, inspiration, and appreciation of the fantastic work that has come from SoME participants over the years. While we have worked hard to preserve as much information as possible, please note that some data, such as vote breakdowns or thumbnails, may not be available for all entries.

To visit the Archive of Math Expositions:

We look forward to seeing how this resource will continue to inspire and foster our growing community of math enthusiasts.

Happy exploring!

Best,
Fred
For the SoME team

Subject: One week left to submit your entry!
---

Hi!

If you're a creator, you still have about one week left before the deadline on August 18th to submit your entry. If you're a bit behind, don't worry â€” you still have time to catch up! ðŸ’ª

If you already sent your entry, there nothing more you need to do â€” this is just a friendly reminder about the deadline.

Whether you're a creator or a judge, you can register here: https://some.3b1b.co/register.

For a warmup, why not have a look at our new voting algorithm? Here's an overview of the history, benchmark and science behind our current implementation: https://some.3b1b.co/algorithm ðŸ˜‰

Happy reading!

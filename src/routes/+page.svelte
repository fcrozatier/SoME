		<p>
			Creators or group of Creators can submit an entry until <span class=""

			If you want to participate as a judge you can register at any time, even after the vote has

	<details>
		<summary>
			<div class="text-xl font-medium">Is there a topic constraint?</div>
		</summary>
		<p>It has to be about math or something related.</p>
		<p>
			Here we mean &laquo; math &raquo; very broadly, and more applied topics like physics or
			computer science are abundantly welcome. It just has to be the case that a viewer/reader might
			come away knowing something mathematical they didn't before.
		</p>
		<p>
			The topic could be at any level, whether that's basic math for young children or higher-level
			math. If you're assuming a certain background level for the target audience, kindly mention it
			below.
		</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>
			<div class="text-xl font-medium">What software should I use?</div>
		</summary>
		<p>
			You can use any software you're familiar with, there's no constraint. You can even use no
			visualization software at all!
		</p>
		<p>
			What matters most is to find your own style, as this will make you stand out during the vote.
			And you'll have more fun making things your way.
		</p>
		<p>
			So feel no pressure to copy anyone's style, we'll enjoy your entry even more if it's original,
			so go have fun!
		</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>
			<div class="text-xl font-medium">How many entries can I submit?</div>
		</summary>
		<p>One entry per person / group</p>

			We hope you make more, but we only have the capacity to judge participants based on a single
			entry.
		</p>

		<summary>
			<div class="text-xl font-medium">Can I use an old entry?</div>
		</summary>
		<p>It has to be something new you make this summer</p>
		<p>
			The spirit of this is to encourage people who've never put stuff online before. If you want to
			work on something you sort of started once before, that's probably fine, but it can't be
			something you already published before this contest. Optimally, you'd use this as a chance to
			try something new you otherwise might not have.
		</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>
			<div class="text-xl font-medium">Does it have to be in English?</div>
		</summary>
		<p>It has to be available in English: subtitles or translation are needed.</p>
		<p>
			If you want to put out an explainer in another language, wonderful! Please do! But the judges
			here will be English speakers, so to be considered for the contest the lesson has to be
			accessible to them.

			<div class="text-xl font-medium">How will winners be selected?</div>
		</summary>
		<p>
			This year's competition is run by the community, and as such, there will not be manual peer
			review nor prize money for winners as in previous editions.
		</p>
		<p>
			However the voting process will sift through the entries and give greater visibility to the
			better ones. The winning entries of this edition will determined by the vote and will be
			revealed at the end of the competition.
		</p>
		<p>Here's what we're looking for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Motivation:</b> It should be clear by the end of the introduction why one should care.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> Clarity: </b>
				Jargon should be explained, the goals of the lesson should be understandable with minimal background,
				and the submission should generally display empathy for people unfamiliar with the topic.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Novelty:</b> It doesn't necessarily have to be an original idea or original topic, but it
				should offer someone an experience they might otherwise not have by searching around online.
				Some of the greatest value comes from covering common topics in better ways. Other times there's
				value in surfacing otherwise obscure ideas which more people should know about.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Memorability:</b> Something should make the piece easy to remember even several months later.
				Maybe it's the beauty of the presentation, the enthusiasm of the presenter, or the mind-blowingness
				of an aha moment.
			</li>
